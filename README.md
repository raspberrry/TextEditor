Text Editor using linked lists

It is an implementation of a text editor using linked lists. The text is essentially lists of characters, where each list is a line in the text and a line is a sequence of characters terminated by a newline character. The whole text could be represented as a doubly-linked list of lines and each line as a doubly-linked list of characters with each character as a node. The editor has a single cursor at any place in the text including a blank line (a blank line has a newline character because every line has a newline character at the end; so a blank line is not really blank). When a new empty text is created, it is created with an empty line and the cursor is at the beginning of the text, that is, at the newline character of the only empty line. Text always has at least one line. A character is any displayable ASCII character except the newline character (ASCII code of newline character is 13, whereas displayable ASCII characters starts from 32). The editor can take the following operations.
